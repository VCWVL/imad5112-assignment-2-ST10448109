#The History app purpose
This History QuizApp is an Android quiz app which is designed to test users' knowledge on South Africaâ€™s history. The goal of my app is to provide a more interactive and user-friendly platform where users can take a quiz, receive instant feedback, whilst tracking their scores.

#User Interface
The user interface has an easy and more visually engaging design. The app works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. I have included clear fonts, contrasting colours, images relating to the quiz theme, and large buttons for better usability. At the end of the quiz, it will have an instant display of correct/incorrect answers and the total score.

#Utilisation of github and github actons
This project was pushed to GitHub for better version tracking and the use of branches for new functions, which are merged after all reviews.
The code runs and tests on every push.
It deploys builds to a staging environment.
